# Pee-Racer
    ## LET US MAKE URINATING HETEROCLITIC,SILLY AND AMUSING.

# MIT Media India Innovation Lab 2015 Workshop Project    

We started working on our track synchronous tools. We were supposed to make a project that is heteroclitic, funny, silly and as well as having synchronicity in it. So first we tried to figure it out by thinking by individually in the group. Ideation of the project was the most difficult part of the project. We all four members of the group came with different ideas about the project. All the members presented different scenarios. Some ideas were funny but not having synchronicity within it. Some ideas were synchronous but not amazing.

After long brainstorm and discussion with our mentors and with my group, we decided to go with craziest one .we came up with one of the most unique, silly, funny idea having synchronicity in it that and we called it that pee racing.
